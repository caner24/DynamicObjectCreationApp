<h1>Dynamic API Project</h1>
This project demonstrates the creation of dynamic APIs using .NET with various modern design patterns and tools. It features a scalable and robust API architecture, including caching, validation, and rate-limiting.

Features
<ul>
<li>Dynamic API Generation: Automatically generated endpoints based on user-defined specifications.</li>
<li>Docker Orchestrator: Used .NET Aspire to manage and orchestrate microservices.</li>
<li>Caching with Redis: Implemented caching for efficient data retrieval and reduced latency.</li>
<li>CQRS and MediatR: Used for separating read and write operations, promoting scalability and maintainability.</li>
<li>FluentResult: Implemented as a design pattern for handling operation results in a clean and consistent way.</li>
<li>FluentValidation: Integrated for input validation, ensuring data integrity and reducing errors.</li>
<li>Rate-Limiting: Added to protect the API from being overwhelmed with excessive requests.</li>
<li>Redis: For caching and improving the performance of API responses.</li>
<li>CQRS + MediatR: Implemented for a scalable architecture.</li>
<li>FluentResult: For handling operation outcomes in a structured manner.</li>
<li>FluentValidation: For validating incoming requests.</li>
<li>Rate-Limiting: To prevent abuse and maintain optimal API performance.</li>
</ul>
